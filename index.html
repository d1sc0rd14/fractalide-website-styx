  <p>The vision is to create three foundational applications that run on an existing programming platform called Fractalide.
<ol>
  <li><b>Hyperflow</b>: A Rapid Application Development (RAD) platform</li>
  <li><b>Fractalmarket</b>: An integrated app marketplace</li>
  <li><b>Etherflow</b>: A new Ethereum Classic client</li>
</ol>

<b>Hyperflow</b> facilitates the creation of applications which can be published on <b>Fractalmarket</b>. <b>Etherflow</b> allows people to purchase applications on <b>Fractalmarket</b> or interact with other Ethereum Classic holders and contracts.

<h5>Hyperflow: Rapid Application Development platform</h5>
Hyperflow draws much inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a>. HyperCard was intuitive, semantically clear and easy to learn such that non-programmers could create powerful programs that solved real world problems at hand.
<br>HyperCard had two modes; an execution mode and development mode. Switching between the two modes was trivial and didn't require a compilation step. In develop mode, people built their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) by dragging and dropping GUI widgets such as a button or textbox onto a canvas. This canvas was referred to as a Card. One could then write an English like programming language (called HyperTalk) to drive the execution of your Card GUI components and link Cards together. A set of Cards formed a Stack. The nearest analogy would be a Card is a web page and a Stack would be a website. People created Stacks which did anything from computer games to bookkeeping.

<br><br>Hyperflow takes the good parts of HyperCard such as the simple intuitive development/execution environment that allows non-programmers to rapidly build applications, but chooses to reject certain shortcomings, namely not being able to share stacks over a network, and the English like language HyperTalk wasn't powerful enough for professional programmers.

<br><br>We will swap out HyperTalk for a component oriented programming language called Flowscript (which is an implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-based Programming language</a>). These components are typically written in modern day programming languages and are <b>designed</b> to be shareable, reusable and reproducible. The nearest analogy is Lego. Programmers create the lego blocks and non-programmers use the Lego blocks. So in this environment we can create a synergy between programmers and non-programmers. Programmers retain their custom powerful development environments and non-programmers can easily use their components to build powerful applications to solve real world problems.

<br><br>Which leads us to the next point. We need a way to share these powerful components with the world!

<h5>Fractalmarket: an Integrated App Marketplace</h5>
Once the above HyperCard layer is completed applications can be built. A Marketplace app will be among the first few applications created. Very similar to how you have an Appstore app on your phone, this Fractalide Marketplace app allows you to search and pay for applications that run on Fractalide.

<br><br>Though unlike the appstore, components that make up an application are shareable and may be included in other component hierachies. The original author is compensated for their work every time their component is sold even when it forms part of a component hierarchy created by another person.

<br><br>These dynamics reward programmers for creating intuitive, reusable, efficient, well maintained components.

<br><br>The last notable point about the marketplace is that a new cryptocurrency will be created enabling trade between buyers and sellers. This is the very same coin that can be purchased in the ICO.

<h5>Etherflow: A New Ethereum Classic Client</h5>
Etherflow builds on top of the work of ETCDEV by utilizing the modular Ethereum Classic Emerald SDK libraries. Etherflow aims to be a fully singing and dancing Ethereum Classic client. Allowing applications created by Hyperflow to perform transactions on the blockchain, interact with deployed cryptocontracts or just be wallet for the normal user.
<br>
Programmers will be hired to assist in the implementation of Emerald SDK and integration with Etherflow.
<br><br>
<h5>Future Work</h5>
Once the above requirements are implemented, future work on network overlays and building out libraries for the Internet of Things takes priority.

  <p>    <b>Token Name:</b> Fractal Coin<br>
    <b>Token Symbol:</b> FRC<br>
    <b>Token Purpose:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Initial Coin Offering allows one to purchase FRACTAL coins which will be traded in the integrated marketplace.
      </li>
      <li>
        A buyer is someone who is prepared to offer FRACTALS for desired software available in the integrated marketplace that runs on Fractalide.
      </li>
      <li>
        A seller is someone who writes Fractalide compatible software and makes it available on the integrated marketplace and is prepared to accept FRACTALS in return.
      </li>
      <li>
        FRACTALS may also be used to contract programmers to write custom components.
      </li>
      <li>
        A component author will always be compensated upon every sale even if their component forms part of another programmer's component hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmers write components, non-programmers may compose components and sell them in the integrated marketplace. This Rapid Application Development environment is designed for non-programmers to solve problems. So money doesn't just flow to programmers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Not a Security:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fractalide's ICO is <b>not</b> a security, you cannot earn dividends from your contribution.
      </li>
      <li>
      The FRACTAL coin <b>does not</b> represent company equity.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is a free and open source project, you will not be relying entirely on this organization and team to make FRACTALS worth more. It takes an entire community of people building software, sharing and contributing for this community and the FRACTAL coin to become valuable.
      </li>
      <li>
        This project can be summed up nicely with this satement by Greg Medcraft, chairman of ASIC:
<br><code>They're a very interesting concept. An ICO is not equity – you're offering basically something that is the product of the entity that is doing the launch. You're taking a bet on getting that product early. How different is that if I go to Kickstarter and I buy something – a watch – and then I get that watch and sell it in the future? It's no different, is it?</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Risks:</b><br>
    Despite much of the research already being done and problem points solved, there are still risks associated with investing in this project.
    Below are a list of the risks. We hope you can consider these risks and take appropriate measures.
    The project can fail for a number of reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Should the FRACTAL coin not be listed on an exchange it will be difficult to see an increase in value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designing the fair compensation for contribution marketplace is a tricky problem. It could result in a number of different iterations and improvements for it to work well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether or not people will enjoy programming and use it to solve real world problems en mass is also uncertain.
      </li>
      <li>
        As is the case in the ETH community, many ETH ICOs have converted their contributed ETH into Fiat currency as fast as possible which creates instablitiy in the cryptocurrency market. We have no intention of getting out of ETC (other than operational expenses) and are committed to this community for the long run. Indeed we aim for our programmers to be paid in ETC.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Invest</b><br>
    Please participate in the ICO over at Token Mint as long as you follow these guidelines:
    <ul>
      <li>Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.</li>
      <li>Don't invest in things you don't understand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Note: Token Mint has not launched yet so the ICO isn't ready yet
